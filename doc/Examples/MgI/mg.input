// Neutral magnesium - this system has two-electrons above closed-shells and works well with both CI and
// MBPT. It is not an inherently "hole"-y system, but adding single-electron excitations from the
// 2p-shell does slightly improve the accuracy.
//
// This calculation is small enough to run on most laptops or personal computers, but requires OpenMP to
// complete in a reasonable length of time. Errors are ~5% but can be greatly improved with larger CI
// and MBPT basis sizes (e.g. more partial waves, greater maximum pqn).
