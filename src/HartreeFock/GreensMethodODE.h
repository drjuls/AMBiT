/** Operator for solving equations of the form
        L psi = source(r)
    where L is a first order differential operator.
    GreensMethodODE is supplied with solutions to the homogenous equation
        L psi = 0
    which are regular at the origin and at infinity, s0 and sInf.
    Then one can express the solution of the original equation as a linear combination
        psi = s0 * A(r) + sInf * B(r).
    A(r) and B(r) will be proportional to functions of the form
        d(GInf)/dr = source(r) * sInf(r) / W
        d(G0)/dr = source(r) * s0(r) / W
    where W is the Wronskian = 1/(s0.f * sInf.g - sInf.f * s0.g).

    For the operator form, rather than the ODE form,
        GInf(r) = Integral[ source(r') * sInf(r') / W , {r' = r, Infinity}]
        G0(r)   = Integral[ source(r') * s0(r') / W , {r' = 0, r}]
    which is easier to obtain from the ODE form. An ODESolver may be supplied to replace the default.
