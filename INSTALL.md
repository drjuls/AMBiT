# Compiling AMBiT

We’ve tested AMBiT and know it works on the Linux and macOS operating
systems. It will probably work on MS Windows or other Unix operating
systems (e.g. FreeBSD, Illumos, etc), but we haven't tried it so we
can't say for sure.

In order to compile AMBiT you’ll need the following software libraries
and tools:

- A C++ compiler with support for C++17, such as GCC, Clang, or the
  Intel C++ compiler.

- [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) - The GNU Scientific
  Library.

- The [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) C++ libraries.

- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (v3) -
  C++ linear algebra package.

- [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) and
  [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) - linear algebra subroutines.
  Can be substituted for internal libraries in the (proprietary)
  [Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl)
  (MKL) or the open-source 
  [OpenBLAS](http://www.openmathlib.org/OpenBLAS/) library. Compiling
  against MKL or OpenBLAS allows expensive linear-algebra
  operations (including generating angular data) to be automatically
  parallelised at run-time.

- [Google Abseil](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp)

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) software build tool.

- (Optional) OpenMP and MPI - parallel programming libraries to run
    AMBiT on high-performance computing clusters. These will generally be
    cluster-specific, although OpenMP is supported by default on both GCC
    and the Intel C++ compiler.

Most of these dependencies can be installed from your operating system's
pacakge manager (e.g. apt-get in Ubuntu, dnf in Fedora or Homebrew in
macOS). Some package managers have separate "development" packages, which
you must also install to be able to compile AMBiT against them. These
development packages tend to have names ending with some variation on "dev",
such as `liblapack-dev` on Ubuntu.

It is important that Boost dependencies are built with the same compiler as
the rest of AMBiT. Some package managers (such as Homebrew or the module
systems on HPC clusters) do not guarantee this, which can cause crashes and
unpredictable behaviour at run-time. Consult your system's documentation
for instructions on how to ensure AMBiT and Boost are built with compatible
compilers.

## Compilers
AMBiT makes extensive use of modern C++ features, and requires a compiler which supports at least
C++17. Notably, AMBiT requires a toolchain (C++ compiler and standard library) which supports the
`filesystem` library introduced in the C++17 standard; a table showing the minimum versions of
major compilers which support this feature can be found at this link:
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17#C.2B.2B17_library_features>.

The following compilers are known to work with AMBiT:
- GCC with `libstdc++` v8.x or later
- Intel "Classic" C++ compiler (`icpc`, not the newer LLVM-based compiler `icpx`) v2023 or later
- Clang with `libc++` v7.x or later

There is a bug in the newer LLVM-based Intel C++ compiler (`icpx`, released in 2024) which causes the
compiler to crash when compiling AMBiT; use the "Classic" Intel C++ compiler or GCC instead.

## Building with CMake
### Quick start
Do this to build AMBiT in `./build` and install it to a sensible directory:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

The AMBiT build process is based around a build tool called CMake, which handles both build
configuration and the actual compilation. CMake is a powerful, highly-customisable tool; we provide
a brief overview here, but see the official 
[Kitware CMake FAQ](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/FAQ)
and [documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/) for more detailed instructions.

###Configuring
A CMake build has three conceptual stages:

1. Configuration, including setting compiler options and finding external libraries,
2. Compilation, which can optionally be done in parallel on multi-core machines, 
3. Installation, where CMake copies the final `ambit` binary executable to another directory.

We recommend compiling AMBiT in a dedicated folder, as this keeps everything neat and tidy, and
makes it easy to quickly clean up things like shared objects by just deleting the build folder.
For concreteness, we'll use `build` as the name of the build folder for the examples throughout
this guide.

The first stage, configuration, is the most complex and is CMake's "special sauce". It lets us
specify a choice of compiler (and compiler flags), toggle different modes of parallelism, and set
up (or automatically infer) the paths and options for linking to external libraries. To configure
the build, make sure you're in the base-level AMBiT directory and run:

```bash
cmake -B build
```

This creates a folder called `build` in the current directory and populates it with basic CMake
scaffolding. We can provide additional options to CMake via command line options of the form:

```bash
cmake -B build -D<OPTION>=<VALUE>
```

For example, to build AMBiT with MPI and OpenMP, we need to set `USE_MPI=true` and 
`USE_OPENMP=true` during configuration, we'd do:

```bash
cmake -B build -DUSE_MPI=true -DUSE_OPENMP=true
```

We can leave most build options unspecified and CMake will attempt to automatically infer
sensible defaults, but these inferences can be explicitly overridden if required. It may be
necessary to explicitly specify the paths to some of the libraries required by AMBiT, since CMake
may not be able to automatically find the libraries on all systems (especially if there are
multiple versions available).

CMake can often automatically find and configure the external libraries needed by AMBiT, but may
sometimes struggle on systems with non-standard installation directories (especially on HPC
systems using non-standard environment modules). The CMake configuration step will fail if it can't
find any of the required libraries, in which case you'll need to manually set the paths using one
of the CMake options listed below.

Here is a short list of CMake options for AMBiT:

- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`: location to install AMBiT (you must have read/write permissions for this
  directory)
- `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`: C++ compiler to use when compiling AMBiT. For MPI-enabled builds, this must be manually set to the correct MPI compiler wrappers (e.g. `mpiCC` for OpenMPI)
- `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`: Flags to pass to the C++ compiler
- `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` (case sensitive): Fortran compiler to use when compiling Davidson eigensolver
- `CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS` (case sensitive): Flags to pass to the Fortran compiler
- `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`: additional paths for CMake configuration files for external libraries. Only
  necessary when CMake's automatic package configuration fails
- `EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR`: directory containing Eigen header files
- `USE_OPENMP`: toggle whether to use OpenMP multithreading parallelism
- `USE_MPI`: toggle whether to use MPI parallelism
- `USE_OPENBLAS`: toggle whether to use OpenBLAS for linear algebra operations. Incompatible with
  `USE_MKL`.
- `USE_MKL`: toggle whether to use MKL for linear algebra operations. Incompatible with
  `USE_OPENBLAS`.
- `MKL_INTERFACE_FULL`: MKL library interface to link against (see below for more details)
- `MKL_THREADING`: backend library to use for multithreaded linear algebra operations (see below
  for more details)
- `MKL_MPI`: choice of MPI library to use for MKL (must be the same as used by AMBiT)
- `EIGEN_USE_BLAS`: (when set to `true`) use an external BLAS library for linear algebra. When this
  option is enabled, you'll need to manually provide compile and link flags for a suitable library
  with a BLAS-compatible interface.
- `USE_SCALAPACK`: toggle whether to enable ScaLAPACK as a solver for the CI matrix. `USE_MPI` must be enabled when
  using this option. If `USE_MKL` is enabled then AMBiT will use MKL's ScaLAPACK implementation (which is usually
  higher-performing than the open-source options), otherwise it will search for a "plain" (i.e. Netlib) ScaLAPACK
  installation.
- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: choose the build type. Options include
  - `Release` (`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`) the default, optimised build
  - `Debug`
  - `RelWithDebInfo`
- `BUILD_TESTING`: (for developers) toggle whether to build unit testing suite (see below for more
  details)

###Compiling
Once we've configured the build, we can compile AMBiT by doing

```bash
cmake --build build
```

Additionally, you can pass the `-j` option to tell `cmake` to use
multiple cores when compiling AMBiT. For example, we can use all available CPU cores on a system by
doing:

```bash
cmake --build build -j $(nproc)
```

which will considerably speed up the build process by using compiling multiple files at a time in
parallel.

###Installing
Finally, we can install AMBiT by running:

```bash
cmake --install build
```

You might need to `sudo` this command. By default, this will try to install AMBiT somewhere like `/usr/local/bin/ambit`. This directory is often not
writable on shared systems like HPC clusters, so we usually want to set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
during configuration to some directory we have write-access to. In this case, CMake will install
AMBiT to `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/ambit`, so for example:

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./installed
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

will install AMBiT to `./installed/bin/ambit`.

## Building with OpenBLAS
OpenBLAS can provide substantial speedups for linear algebra operations compared to Eigen's
internal libraries (the default if no options are specified). CMake can usually find OpenBLAS
automatically when `USE_OPENBLAS=true`, but if it fails then you may need to manually specify the
path to the OpenBLAS installation via the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` variable.

OpenBLAS can either run in multithreaded or single-threaded mode, depending on how the library was
compiled. In order to get actual multithreading, OpenBLAS must have been compiled with *both*
"multithreading" and "OpenMP" support, otherwise it will run on a single CPU core when called by
AMBiT to avoid deadlocks with the OpenMP runtime. See [this GitHub 
issue](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/2543) or the [OpenBLAS 
FAQ](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/wiki/Faq#wronglibrary) for more info.

If you are not building OpenMP from source, the build-options
will have been handled by your OS's package manager or cluster's administrators. Even in 
single-threaded, OpenBLAS will typically be faster than the default BLAS/LAPACK libraries.

## Building with MKL
Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) can provide substantial speedups for linear algebra operations,
but it has many configuration options and can be difficult to link against. Fortunately, MKL
releases greater than `2021.3` have good support for CMake, so most of the necessary configuration
can by done by setting CMake variables. CMake can usually find MKL automatically, but if it fails
then you may need to manually specify the path to the MKL CMake configuration (i.e. the folder
containing `MKLConfig.cmake`) by setting the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` configuration variable.

It's important to note that MKL supports two different linking interfaces for its dynamic
libraries: 64-bit integers (the default) and 32-bit integers.
These can be set via the `MKL_INTERFACE_FULL` CMake option. Eigen (which AMBiT uses for linear
algebra operations) can use MKL as a backend, but it only works with the 32-bit interface and will
crash at run-time (usually with a segmentation fault) if compiled with the default 64-bit
interface.

As a result, you must explicitly request the 32-bit interface when compiling AMBiT by setting
`MKL_INTERFACE_FULL` in the configuration stage. The exact value this variable must be set to can
be different depending on your configuration, but it's usually one of either
`-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=lp64` or `-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=intel_lp64` (for Intel compilers), or
`-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=gf_lp64` (for GNU). If `MKL_INTERFACE_FULL` is not explicitly set, then
CMake will print the possible options in the configuration output. Consult the documentation for
your version of MKL, as well as for Eigen, if you are unsure:

- [CMake Config for
oneMKL](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2024-0/cmake-config-for-onemkl.html),
- [Using the ILP64 Interface vs. LP64 Interface](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/onemkl/developer-guide-linux/2024-0/using-the-ilp64-interface-vs-lp64-interface.html),
- [Using Intel MKL from Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicUsingIntelMKL.html)

MKL supports using multithreading to do linear algebra operations in parallel, which can
provide substantial speedups when enabled. There are multiple supported backends, but it's
important to select one that's compatible with the compiler you are using to build AMBiT. You can
specify which backend MKL should use by setting the `MKL_THREADING` CMake variable to one of the
following values:

- `sequential`: no multithreading
- `intel_thread`: Intel's *OpenMP* implementation (default)
- `tbb_thread`: Intel's *Threading Building Blocks* library
- `gnu_thread`: The GNU/GCC *OpenMP* implementation

While it is technically possible to "mix and match" libraries, the safest choice is to set
`MKL_THREADING=gnu_thread` if you're using GCC, or `MKL_THREADING=intel_thread` if you're using the
Intel compilers. If no value is supplied then it will default to using
`MKL_THREADING=intel_thread`.

Lastly, when building with MPI, it can be useful to explicitly tell MKL which MPI library to link against. Usually,
the default option MKL picks will be fine, but not all MPI implementations are mutually compatible, which can cause
run-time crashes or performance degradations. To pass the MPI implementation to MKL, use the CMake variable 
`-DMKL_MPI`, which accepts the following values:

- `intelmpi`: Intel MPI
- `mpich`: MPICH
- `openmpi`: OpenMPI
- `mshpc`: Mirosoft HPC Pack
- `msmpi`: Microsoft MPI (Note: Microsoft MPI is now called MS HPC. The `msmpi` option is only kept around for
  compatibility with legacy systems)

Check with your cluster's documentation to see which MPI library you should use here.

## Building with an alternative BLAS library
It's possible to force Eigen to use an external BLAS library of your choosing by setting
`EIGEN_USE_BLAS=true`, which tells Eigen not to use it's internal libraries and to instead defer
the choice of BLAS library to link-time options. This means you will need to manually specify the
compile and link options (for example, by adding them to `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`) rather than letting
CMake handle them, but it allows you to use any library with a compatible BLAS interface if, for
example, your system does not support OpenBLAS or MKL. See this page in the Eigen documentation for
more information: <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicUsingBlasLapack.html>.

## Building the test suite
AMBiT has a set of automated unit and regression tests via 
[GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and CMake's inbuilt `ctest` runner program.
Running tests can often catch bugs well before they show up in production, so we we recommend
running the test suite early and often if you're developing AMBiT or adding your own functionality.

To enable tests, set `BUILD_TESTING=true` when configuring with CMake, then compile as normal -
CMake will automatically download GoogleTest and build the test suite. Once the tests have been
built, change into the build directory (e.g. `./build`) and run `ctest`, e.g.:

```bash
cmake -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=true
cmake --build build
cd build
ctest
```

Note that the unit tests do not currently support MPI parallelism, so you must also compile with
`USE_MPI=no` to build the test suite.

Use `ctest -V` to print "verbose" diagnostic output to the terminal for the whole test suite, 
and `ctest --output-on-failure` to print diagnostics for only those tests which fail. 
Additionally, it can sometimes be useful to only run a subset of the test suite while debugging, 
which can by providing a test or group of tests via `ctest -R` e.g.:

```bash
ctest -R AngularDataTester
```

Will run just the AngularData tests and exit (`ctest -R` also accepts test IDs in the form of
regular expressions).

You can also run `ctest --help` for a full list of possible options when running unit tests.

## Example build options

### MacOS

We recommend using the [homebrew](https://brew.sh) package manager on MacOS systems. Your MacBook or MacPro has a single shared pool of memory, so it is best to compile with OpenMP and not MPI. Step by step instructions for an 8-core Mac:

1. Install dependencies  
   `brew install gcc gsl boost eigen abseil cmake libomp`
2. Set environment variable to find OpenMP  
   `export OpenMP_ROOT=$(brew --prefix)/opt/libomp`
3. Build AMBiT and install it somewhere in `$PATH`

   ```bash
   cmake -B build -DUSE_OPENMP=true
   cmake --build build -j 8
   sudo cmake --install build
   ```

4. Test it for your preferred number of threads

   ```bash
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=8
   ambit template.input
   ```

You might like to set the default environment variables by putting the `export` commands in your `~/.profile` (bash) or `~/.zprofile` (zsh) configuration files. Thanks to Steven Worm (DESY) for help with this configuration.

### Gadi supercomputer (NCI Australia)

This is intended only as an example of building for a CPU-based cluster. We use Gadi for large jobs run over several nodes. Gadi uses a module system, but does not have a module for Abseil at the time of writing. 

We install Abseil using CMake in a user directory which we write as `<home>` below (instructions [here](https://abseil.io/docs/cpp/quickstart-cmake.html)). Abseil is configured with the flag `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<home>/abseil-cpp/installed`. We also needed to point CMake at Abseil and Eigen explicitly in the AMBiT configuration step.

The `ANGULAR_DATA_DIR` is set to a group directory so that angular data is shared between different users by default (you can override this at runtime). The `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is also set to the group directory.

Our configuration step looks like:

```bash
cmake -B build \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpiCC -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=mpifort \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<home>/abseil-cpp/installed/lib64/cmake/absl/ \
  -DEigen3_DIR=/apps/eigen/3.3.7/share/eigen3/cmake/ \
  -DUSE_OPENMP=yes -DUSE_MPI=yes \
  -DUSE_MKL=yes \
  -DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=gf_lp64 \
  -DMKL_THREADING=gnu_thread \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<group> \
  -DANGULAR_DATA_DIR=<group>/AngularData/
```

## Troubleshooting common build errors

### CMake fails to automatically find the path to external dependencies
**Example error output**:

```
CMake Error at src/CMakeLists.txt:16 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "absl" with any of
  the following names:

    abslConfig.cmake
    absl-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "absl" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "absl_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "absl"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
```

This error occurs when you have installed one of AMBiT's external dependencies in a non-standard
location (e.g. not in `/usr/lib` or similar global locations). It also occurs if the dependency is not installed at all.

**Fix**: All of AMBiT's external dependencies have native support for CMake, so ensure the
directories where the problem package is installed has one of the `.cmake` files mentioned in the
error message (they'll usually be installed in something like `/path/to/installation/lib/cmake`)
and modify the `[lib]_DIR` (where `[lib]` is the library name reported by CMake, e.g. `absl_DIR`)
or `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` build options to include this path.

### AMBiT crashes on a segmentation fault when calling into MKL functions

Eigen only works with MKL as a backend via MKL's 32-bit integer interface
(which Intel calls `LP64`) (see: <https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicUsingIntelMKL.html>), which
we can control by setting the `-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL` CMake variable. The exact value required
varies, but it's usually one of either `-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=lp64` or
`-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=intel_lp64` (for Intel compilers), or `-DMKL_INTERFACE_FULL=gf_lp64` (for GNU
compilers).

### Building with MKL and GCC fails due to missing `libiomp*.so` library

Intel MKL has multiple ways of enabling multithreading for libear algebra operations, which are
controlled by setting the `MKL_THREADING` CMake variable to one of the following choices:

- `sequential`: no multithreading
- `intel_thread`: Intel's *OpenMP* implementation (default)
- `tbb_thread`: Intel's *Threading Building Blocks* library
- `gnu_thread`: The GNU/GCC *OpenMP* implementation

If no value is supplied to `MKL_THREADING`, it will default to using `intel_thread`, which requires
the `libiomp` library to be available. This will usually be fine if you're using the Intel compilers,
but may not be present when compiling AMBiT with GCC so you'll need to set
`MKL_THREADING=gnu_thread`.

### Compilation fails when using Intel LLVM C++ compiler `icpx`
**Example error output:**

```
icpx: error: clang frontend command failed with exit code 139 (use -v to see invocation)
Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2024.1.0 (2024.1.0.20240308)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/2024.1/bin/compiler
```

**Fix:** 
There is a bug in the newer LLVM-based Intel C++ compiler (`icpx`, released in 2024) which causes the
compiler to crash when compiling AMBiT; use the "Classic" Intel C++ compiler (`icpc`) or GCC instead.
